            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
              When reflecting on my time in New York, it's almost automatic for
              me to share how much this city has opened my eyes to what a truly
              global city is like. Whenever friends ask me about New York, I
              find myself emphasizing about the sheer vibrancy of the cityâ€”how
              it's constantly buzzing with culture, entertainment, and sports.
              Before visiting, my perspective, like many others, was shaped by
              cities like Singapore or Tokyo, but those experiences pale in
              comparison to NYC. Two factors helped clarify those distinctions
              for me: the duration of my stay and, naturally, the focus of the
              class on global cities.
            </p>
            <p>
              As someone with an artsy inclination, I was particularly struck by
              how abundant the cultural scene is in New York. Thereâ€™s an endless
              array of activities to engage in after dark. Places like the
              Lincoln Center, for instance, offer a variety of free events for
              the public, from silent discos to comedy shows. I also remember
              attending a free hip-hop concert with some members of the class.
              The lead artist spoke about how he made it in New York and how, by
              organizing and performing at these shows, heâ€™s giving back to the
              community by making this open to anyone and everyone. Itâ€™s
              inspiring to see how art and culture in New York arenâ€™t just about
              consumption; theyâ€™re about community, participation, and paying it
              forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ve observed that art in New York transcends individual
              enjoyment, becoming a collective experience that shapes the cityâ€™s
              cultural landscape. However, this leads me to wonder how these
              vibrant art and music scenes were cultivated and nurtured over
              time. Reflecting on my experience at Tembusu College, Iâ€™m inspired
              by the passion of a few students who organize arts week concerts
              and craft workshops. Yet, I canâ€™t help but think that the arts
              scene in Singapore might feel somewhat stifled in comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Singapore, many art-related activities are often quite pricey
              or not well-advertised, making them less accessible to the average
              student. I understand that this perspective might be flawed, and I
              recognize that others could argue there are plenty of
              opportunities in Singaporeâ€™s arts scene. However, these are just
              my observations based on my experiences and reflections. Perhaps
              an app could be developed that aggregates and shares news about
              events and activities, similar to how Time Out magazine curates
              local happenings.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel that to build a thriving arts scene, there must first be a
              demand and a base of consumers who appreciate and support the
              arts. This base is a cornerstone for artists to flourish and for a
              cultural ecosystem to develop. In New York, for example, the
              cityâ€™s vibrant arts scene is supported by a diverse population
              that values creativity, and this is reflected in the abundance of
              art galleries, theaters, and cultural events.
            </p>
            <p>
              The situation is different here. Although there are well-meaning
              art programs in schools, the arts are not typically seen as a
              viable career path. The societal focus is often on career pathways
              that are perceived to bring in more financial stability, which is
              why many parents discourage their children from pursuing the arts.
              Those who do pursue artistic careers often come from more affluent
              families who can afford to support them financially, allowing them
              to take the risks associated with a less conventional career path.
            </p>
            <p>
              During a visit to a flea market in New York, Bhanuka and I had a
              conversation with a creative who had moved from Singapore to New
              York. He shared with us that, as someone with an artsy background,
              he found limited opportunities in Singapore. The intellectual
              freedom he sought was difficult to come by, which ultimately led
              him to relocate to New York, where the demand for and appreciation
              of the arts allowed him to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
              John Adams, the 2nd President of the United States, once said, "I
              must study politics and war, that our sons may have the liberty to
              study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study
              mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, and naval
              architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to
              give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music,
              architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain." As it stands,
              our society is not yet ready to fully embrace the arts as a core
              part of cultural and intellectual development, whereas Americans
              have long recognized creativity as essential to a thriving
              society; Americans can keep their dream, we can keep our
              pragmatism.
            </p>
            <p>
              This difference in demand and cultural support is a significant
              factor in why some artists, like the creative we met, feel the
              need to leave Singapore in search of more fertile ground for their
              talents. It highlights the importance of not just providing
              education and opportunities in the arts, but also cultivating a
              society that values and consumes artistic expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my time in New York, Iâ€™ve made it a priority to
              maximize every moment, determined to visit every spot on my list,
              whether I was genuinely interested or not. This often meant
              rushing through places, more focused on ticking off boxes than
              truly enjoying the experiences. Itâ€™s like I was going through a
              checklist, driven by a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out), which
              pushed me to see everything, even if I didnâ€™t have to.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realize now that this mindset might stem from the typical short
              holiday mentality, where you know you canâ€™t see everything, so you
              push yourself to cram in as much as possible. But in doing so, I
              sometimes missed out on actually enjoying the places I visited. I
              vividly remember the final day of the trip when, while others were
              packing up and taking their time, I was still out exploring the
              southern part of Central Park, eager to see the carousel and
              Bethesda Terrace before leaving. This experience has shown me that
              sometimes, in my rush to see everything, I might miss out on truly
              appreciating the moments that matter most.
